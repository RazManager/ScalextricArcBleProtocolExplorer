# Scalextric ARC BLE Protocol Explorer

Users of the Scalextric ARC powerbases can use the offical app from Scalextric for managing a slot car race. But Scalextric has also made the documentation of the Scalextrix ARC BLE protocol available to anyone that themselves want to develop a similar application. The documentation can be received by sending an e-mail to customerservice@scalextric.com.

This little unoffical utility, the Scalextric ARC BLE Protocol Explorer, helps developers understand how the different parameters in the protocol actually works, so that it becomes easier to develop an application for the Scalextric ARC powerbases.
